# Image-Slider-2
This is written in JavaScript language.
This is the updated version of the previous release of the 'image-slider' repository. 
All bugs have been worked on and updated.
Also because this image slider has no thumbnails beneath from which one could pick an image he/she wishes to pick,
I decided to make it a seperate repository.
